                <p>Tuna, my cat is an ok cat. She is very small and soft but is very sassy. She loves to meow for attention and scream for food. When she meows for attention and you start to pet her, she instantly walks away from your hand. She will continue to rub up on your legs and meow at you but can't stay still long enough for a good pet session. She screams for food even with her automatic feeder and when she eats too fast, she forgets to swallow causing her to regurgitate it back after 30 minutes. She is not a lap cat. She loves getting brushed and will tolerate you picking her up but will never choose to sit on your lap or stay for longer than 30 seconds. But she is a cute cat. One of the prettiest out there with grey-brown calico fur and a white stomach with the cutest little white socks. Even her tiny toe beans are spotted, which is the icing on the cake. I have bought 4 different cat beds for her. I have yet to see her choose to sleep on any of them. She often prefers the ground or the furniture. This website is designed for me to document where I find her sleeping for the next week or so.</p> <br><br>
                <p>I am Rachel, Tuna's owner. I have worked in clinical research for over 4 years specializing in neuroimaging research on autism. I hope to get into medical data science and create new tools and methods to improve healthcare for individuals. How? I am still unsure, but in the next two years I hope to learn many new skills and fields within tech. I also really love wine.</p>
